# BlockLike.js

BlockLike.js is an educational JavaScript library. It bridges the gap between block-based and text-based programming.

BlockLike.js is designed following [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) concepts, methods and patterns. The screen is a centered stage. Interaction is with Sprites. Code is executed in a "paced" manner. Scratch block code and BlockLike.js text code are meant to be as literally similar as possible.

BlockLike.js is written in ES6/ES7 flavored JavaScript. It is environment independent. It can be used anywhere modern JavaScript runs.

See [BlockLike.org](https://www.blocklike.org) for details, [docs](https://www.blocklike.org/docs), [examples](https://www.blocklike.org/example) and [FAQ](https://www.blocklike.org/faq.html).

## Get Started

The easiest way to start with BlockLike.js is using CodePen.IO. Alternatively, you can create an index.html file and include BlockLike.js with the script tag.
